Title: A New Blog

I decided to blog on our blog about our new blog.

**Design**. The blog looks fresh no matter where you read it — be it on your desktop or on your phone.

**Search**. With our new emphasis on search, it made sense to add search to the blog, too.

**Atom feeds**. Only interested in posts about GitHub Enterprise? You can subscribe to Atom feeds of specific categories to get just the perfect mix of information.

Like always, there's more GitHub features and announcements to come — only now they'll be on our fresh new blog.
